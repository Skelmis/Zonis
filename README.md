## Build the docs locally

If you want to build and run the docs locally using sphinx run
```
sphinx-autobuild -a docs docs/_build/html --watch zonis
```
this will build the docs and start a local server; additionally it will list for changes to the source directory ``zonis`` and to the docs source directory ``docs/``.
You can find the built files at ``docs/_build``.
